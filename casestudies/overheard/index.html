      <p>As recipient of the inaugural 3M Art and Technology Prize at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Luxloop was tasked with developing a new way that museum visitors could engage with the permanent collection.</p>

      <p class="">Our primary goal was to create an experience that would add a layer on top of a visitor’s existing interaction with the museum instead of pulling focus away from the most important thing: the art. </p>

      <p>By examining common social interactions in museums, we discovered a tendency for museum goers to listen-in to the conversations around them in the gallery spaces.  Building upon the familiar interaction of a museum audio guide, we decided to develop a custom audio-based augmented reality app that would allow visitors to explore this impulse to eavesdrop. </p>

      <p>Similar to immersive theatre plays such as <span class="italic">Sleep no More</span> and <span class="italic">Hopscotch</span>, Overheard lets users listen-in on the conversations of fictional characters that are embedded in specific sites throughout the museum, allowing users to explore stories in their own way, at their own pace.</p>

      <div class="quote stackedCards fadeInElement">
        Luxloop understood the museum experience through the eyes of the visitor. They wanted to create an audio-only experience so people could be in the museum with eyes up on the art while listening to something totally unique.
        <span class="source">Douglas Hegley, director of media and technology at Mia</span>
      </div>

      <p>We did extensive research on the demographics and motivations of Mia’s museum visitors so that we could create characters that were authentic to the context. We then worked with a screenwriter to craft the dialogue of five 15-minute-long narratives that would be embedded in the museum with <span class="bolder">location-specific audio in 97 rooms, representing over 3000 years of art</span>.</p>

      <div class="inline fadeInElement"><img src="assets/demo.gif" alt=""></div>

      <p>After considering several options for tracking users locations, we deployed a network of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons across the entire museum. We developed a custom algorithm for tracking user location based on the specific needs of Overheard that increased accuracy over 20% compared to existing solutions. Finally, working with the museum’s Media/Technology and Curatorial departments we created a custom content framework that could scale and change to accommodate the museum’s ongoing operations.</p>

      <p>Overheard checks Mia’s collections database and local weather conditions in realtime, so <span class="bolder">the app can dynamically change in response to individual works of art changing or moving, as well as specific weather conditions</span>. This way, the fictional characters are always reacting to and addressing the same real-life environment that the user is in.</p>

      <div class="quote stackedCards fadeInElement">
        Design is about creating an engaging experience. That’s what was so great about Luxloop’s project – they blended technology, design and experiential thinking, and they didn’t get in the way of Mia’s exhibits. They enhance them.
