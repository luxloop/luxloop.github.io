For After ALife Ahead, he was interested in adding Augmented Reality as a virtual living element to the system. Imagining virtual entities living and interacting within the space, Huyghe needed an app that would allow visitors to peek into the virtual realm at any given moment.\n</p>\n\n<h1>Creating a Virtual Living System</h1>\n\n<p>\n  Any living system has a set of basic rules that interact to determine how organisms live, procreate and die. Luxloop worked with Huyghe to develop a living algorithm for the AR that responded to realtime on-site data from the rink such as the temperature, animal movement, and precipitation. The rule-set controlled the AR creatures’ movement, colonization, death rates, and birthrates, allowing the system to live autonomously and be influenced by conditions in the environment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  We built a server-based system that allowed users’ devices to sync to this autonomous world so that even at capacity of 200+ viewers, all visitors would see the same augmented system and animations in real time, bringing to life the illusion that the AR app is a viewport into the augmented living world.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"italic justLeft\">\n  Pierre Huyghe<br>\n  After ALife Ahead<br>\n  2017<br>\n  Ice rink concrete floor; Sand, clay, phreatic water; Bacteria, algea, bee, chimera peacock; Aquarium, black switchable glass, conus textile; Incubator, human cancer cells; Genetic algorithm; Augemented reality; Automated ceiling structure; Rain; Ammoniac; Logic game.\n</p>\n"},{"name":"Al La Do","projectPageLine":"Interactive Fashion Video","headline":"Interactive Fashion Video for Gypsy Sport F/W 2016 Collection","slug":"allado","previewImg":"/assets/projects/gypsysport/cover.jpg","aspectRatio":"9-16","priority":5,"coverImg":"/assets/projects/gypsysport/cover.jpg","roles":["Content Production","Interactive Experience-Design"],"tech":["HTML5"],"team":[{"credit":"Directed by","people":["Greg Luna and Luxloop"]},{"credit":"Featuring","people":["Ty Wells","Clarys Biagi","Jessica Hiestand"]},{"credit":"Soundtrack by","people":["Jaden Smith featuring Willow Smith"]}],"links":[{"address":"https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/exclusive-watch-gypsy-sports-interactive-new-film-with-music-by-jaden-and-willow-smith","text":"i-D"},{"address":"http://www.papermag.com/watch-gypsy-sports-ss16-campaign-video-with-new-music-from-jaden-and-w-1737358014.html","text":"Paper"},{"address":"http://www.nylon.com/articles/willow-jaden-smith-gypsy-sport","text":"Nylon"},{"address":"http://www.thefader.com/2016/04/19/jaden-willow-smith-soundtrack-gypsy-sport-video","text":"Fader"},{"address":"http://www.oystermag.com/watch-jaden-and-willow-smith-times-gypsy-sports-interactive-dance-video","text":"Oyster"}],"content":"\n\n<p class=\"noShowLarge\">\n  Please visit this page on your desktop to try <span class=\"bolder\">Al La Do</span>\n</p>\n\n<div id=\"frameSizer\" style=\"position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-top:55%;\" class=\"noShowTablet\">\n  <iframe id=\"vidFrame\" src=\"http://www.luxloop.com/demo/gs/gsembed.html\" style=\"border:none;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%\"></iframe>\n</div>\n"},{"name":"Black Cloak","projectPageLine":"Immersive Video Environment","headline":"Immersive Video Environment for Pop-up Dinner by Michelin-Star Chef","slug":"blackcloak","previewImg":"/assets/img/bc1.png","aspectRatio":"3-4","priority":2,"coverImg":"/assets/projects/blackcloak/bg.png","showcaseImages":[{"image":"/assets/projects/blackcloak/bc1.png","aspectRatio":"2-3","offset":-100},{"image":"/assets/projects/blackcloak/vr.png","aspectRatio":"2-3"},{"image":"/assets/projects/blackcloak/bc5.png","aspectRatio":"9-16","offset":-200}],"showcaseVersion":2,"roles":["Event Design","Film/Video Production","Pre-visualization","Live Programing","Projection Mapping"],"tech":["Custom Live Video Mixer","CG Rendering and Compositing","VR Previsualization"],"content":"\n<p>\n  Luxloop was approached by Creacíon Events to create a unique installation for a 36-seat pop-up dinner during Art Basel Miami featuring food by Michelin Star chef Vicky Cheng and renowned pastry chef Andrés Lara.\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"/assets/projects/blackcloak/screen1.png\">\n<img src=\"/assets/projects/blackcloak/screen2.png\">\n<img src=\"/assets/projects/blackcloak/screen3.png\">\n<img src=\"/assets/projects/blackcloak/screen4.png\">\n\n<p>\n  Luxloop designed a dining environment with full-room projection to surround the diners and developed a series of short films inspired by Chef Vicky Chen’s menu, transporting the guests to another world based on the dish for each course.
