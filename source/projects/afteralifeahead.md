<p>
  Luxloop was approached to work with artist Pierre Huyghe on After ALife Ahead, the time-based bio-technical system he created for Skulptur Projkete Munster, an arts event that occurs every 10 years in Munster, Germany.
</p>

<p>
  Huyghe’s work often explores the complex interactions between interdependent lifeforms and systems, including living cell cultures, animals, unicellular organisms and technology. For After ALife Ahead, he was interested in adding Augmented Reality as a virtual living element to the system. Imagining virtual entities living and interacting within the space, Huyghe needed an app that would allow visitors to peek into the virtual realm at any given moment.
</p>

<h1>Creating a Virtual Living System</h1>

<p>
  Any living system has a set of basic rules that interact to determine how organisms live, procreate and die. Luxloop worked with Huyghe to develop a living algorithm for the AR that responded to realtime on-site data from the rink such as the temperature, animal movement, and precipitation. The rule-set controlled the AR creatures’ movement, colonization, death rates, and birthrates, allowing the system to live autonomously and be influenced by conditions in the environment.
</p>

<p>
  We built a server-based system that allowed users’ devices to sync to this autonomous world so that even at capacity of 200+ viewers, all visitors would see the same augmented system and animations in real time, bringing to life the illusion that the AR app is a viewport into the augmented living world.
