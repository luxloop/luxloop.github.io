  Luxloop was approached by artist Pierre Huyghe to bring to life a living Augmented Reality element for After ALife Ahead, the time-based bio-technical system he created for <a target="_blank" href =" https://www.skulptur-projekte.de/#/De/Projects/2017/829/HUYGHE">Skulptur Projkete Munster</a>. The Augmented Reality experience tied into the larger living system of the exhibition at an old ice rink and was viewable through a custom mobile application. Huyghe’s work often explores the complex interactions between interdependent lifeforms and systems, including living cell cultures, animals, unicellular organisms and technology.

<h1> Tech</h1>
  We built a server-based system that allowed users’ devices to sync to this autonomous world so that even at capacity of 200+ viewers, all visitors would see the same augmented system and animations in real time, bringing to life the illusion that the AR app is a viewport into the augmented living world.

<h1> Design</h1>

  Any living system has a set of basic rules that interact to determine how organisms live, procreate and die. Luxloop worked with Huyghe to develop a living algorithm for the AR that responded to realtime on-site data from the rink such as the temperature, animal movement, and precipitation. The rule-set controlled the AR creatures’ movement, colonization, death rates, and birthrates, allowing the system to live autonomously and be influenced by conditions in the environment.
