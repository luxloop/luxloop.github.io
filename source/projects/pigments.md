<p>
  LA-based artist Elohim approached Luxloop to create something more personal than a traditional music video.
</p>

<p>
  Pigments is a multi-screen interactive experience that requires the viewer to help keep the video “alive.” Viewers use their mobile device to connect and control the experience within a desktop video browser, and are asked to provide the heartbeat of the song. If they successfully keep the video alive, the are rewarded with a multifaceted video that responds and changes based on their tactile input and creates a shareable, unique heartbeat graphic.
</p>

<p>
  If the viewer stops tapping, the song slowly breaks apart and fades away, until the video ultimately dies.
