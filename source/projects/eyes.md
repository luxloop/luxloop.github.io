<p>
  If The Walls Had Eyes visualizes and humanizes the multiple pairs of eyes that observe the things we putting out into the world on a daily basis, not only by the people we wish to see our personal content, but the digital eyes that are always watching, the ones we don't necessarily think about. Part inspired by an attention-starved roommate, and part by a dream, the interactive projection installation consists of multiple videos that watch and follow the viewer as they pass by.
