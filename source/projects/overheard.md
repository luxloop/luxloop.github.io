<p>
  Overheard is a site-specific audio narrative woven into the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Similar to immersive theatre, it allows you to explore stories in your own way, at your own pace as you journey through the museum.
</p>

<p>
  As you explore the galleries, the app will recognize your location, allowing you to “overhear” characters through your headphones as if they are right there with you. You can listen in on a first date, go on a ghost hunt with children, or catch up with a couple old friends. It will be a new way to move through Mia and experience the incredible works on view through different people’s perspectives and explore the fascinating ways that people can connect with art.
</p>

<p>
  Overheard is the winning project of the inaugural 3M Art and Technology Award that recognizes artistry and innovation in the field of technology.
