<p>
    You Can Play this Wall with Chords is an immersive room-scale projection controlled by a vintage musical keyboard. Initially linking musical moods to colors, as users continue to jam on the keyboard they unlock a world of film footage that reacts and changes in response to their musical mood and style.

<p>
    An experiment in story told via jam-session, Luxloop developed a prototype of the experience to show at NextArt x VRScout's <a href="https://nextart.tech/" title="">Next Art Night at CTRL Collective</a>.
